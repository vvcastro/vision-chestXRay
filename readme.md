# X-Ray Image classification 👋🏻

In this repository I explored some ideas for the classification of chest X-Ray images. The idea is to move from simpler ML approaches to more complex _SOTA_ models.

Specifically, the problem to tackle is the classification of chest X-Ray images from patients with **_Tuberculosis_**, **_Pneumonia_** and no-disease ( **_Normal_** ).
