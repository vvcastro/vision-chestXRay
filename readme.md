# ML methods for X-Ray Image classification

This repository contains a further development of a course project on "AI for Biomedicine". The idea is to start from the same base problem and take the analysis into a bit more complex solutions, also exploring why some of them work better/worse.

Specifically, this repo contains:

1. Dataset Outlook and Analysis
2. Traditional ML approaches
   - Image preprocessing
   - Feature extraction
   - Model development ( mostly SVM )
3. Deep Learning Approaches.
   - Image preprocessing ( if needed )
   - Baseline approach
   - Transfer Learning ( ImageNet and ChestXpert )
   - Transformers
4. XAI improvements.
